# Vacation Suggestion Page

#### This app will present the user with some questions, and it will take there answers and give them a suggested vacation place based off of them, 10/27/2017 <== The date today is the same 4 numbers repeated in a different oreder (kinda awesome)!

#### By **My name is Joseph McKinney and I flew the ship solo in building this app.**

## Description

This app is designed to recieve a few different types of information from the user regarding their name and favorite cake flavor, and then it will send the user to a page where they will fill out a survey about what they are looking for in a vacation destination.  I then take all of their informations that they have provided and return them a suggestion of a place to go that I made up and I also address them by their name and tell them that where they are going makes a great version of their favorite type of cake.
