        <p>Well hey, did somebody say "bring the heat!"?  Because we are saying "go check out Tostralia".  Didn't choose to go somewhere hot?  Well, you shouldn't have put so much faith into the internet.  I mean really.  Anyways, have a great trip.  The link here will direct you to where you can book your flight and accomodations for your trip at a low cost, and don't worry about a rental car, Tostralia has no paved streets so you'll get to walk everywhere you go and burn tons of unwanted calories.</p>

        <p>What can I even say about Tussia?  Honestly I dont really know.  I made the place up for this project so it doesn't really exist outside of my brain.  Although now that you know it too, maybe its more than just that.  Anyways, have some faith, put your trust into us, and just close your eyes and click purchase on the page that this link takes you to.  There are so many wonderful places in the world we live in, why not close your eyes, and let Jesus grab the wheel and see where you end up!</p>

      <div id="salifornia" class="hider">
        <p>Hey look at you.  Based off of the informaion that you have provided us, we find it to be in your best interests to click this link and then to click the buy button on the page it takes you to.  Don't worry about looking into where you are going to end up, it's only like a couple grand for a plane ticket and when it's all said and done then you'll only really have spent like 20-30 thousand dollars on this entire package so what do you really have to lose?</p>
