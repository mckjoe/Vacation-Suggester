        <p>Well hey <span class="firstName"></span>, did somebody say "bring the heat!"?  Because we are saying "go check out Tostralia".  Didn't choose to go somewhere hot?  Well, your answer it seemed like tended toward a warmer environment so... also, you shouldn't have put so much faith into the internet.  I mean really.

        <p>We think you, (<span class="firstName"></span>), better hop a plane to Vivimarlostown.  Vivimarlostown is basically a secluded picturesque mountain range.  You might see a coupole of people, but meh.  It is absolutely stunning there!  Beauty as far as the eye can see! The weather can be pretty predictably aweful, however it is always worth the monsooning rains for the way it keeps the landscape lush.  Duh.

        <p>What can I even say about Tussia, <span class="firstName"></span>? Inviting?  Welcoming?  full of people looking for new friends?  I guess kind of a robust population.  The weather can be insane.  Sun, rain, wind, but always in the winter it is absolutely stunning. Honestly I dont really know.  I made the place up for this project so it doesn't really exist outside of my brain.  Although now that you know it too, maybe its more than just that.
